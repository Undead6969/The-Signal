🎮 Game Title: "The Signal"
🧠 Core Concept:

You are a rescue soldier deployed to investigate a distress signal from Blackstar Research Facility, a top-secret scientific outpost located deep in the Arctic Circle. The mission seems simple — find survivors and extract intel.

But as you arrive… you realize you're not alone. And something has gone terribly wrong.

⏱️ Length:

15–25 minutes of gameplay
(Perfect for a web-based horror shooter)

🔫 Gameplay Style:

First-Person Shooter (WebGL / Three.js or Unity WebGL)

Limited ammo, scavenging

Flashlight with limited battery

Sound-based AI enemies (stealth + shooting)

Psychological horror elements (hallucinations, shifting environments)

🌌 Setting:

Abandoned arctic research facility (tight corridors, flickering lights, frost-covered windows)

Environments include:

Frozen labs

Communications tower

Underground test chamber

📖 STORYLINE (with plot twists):
Act 1 – Arrival

You enter the base. It's eerily silent. Bodies of scientists frozen mid-run.

A distress recording loops: "It woke up. It's in our heads. Do not listen to the signal."

You find logs hinting at an experiment on an ancient signal frequency found under the ice.

Act 2 – The Presence

Strange things start happening: whispering in the comms, doors closing by themselves.

You fight mutated creatures — former staff infected by the signal.

The signal gets louder, and your character begins hallucinating (game distorts, false enemies appear).

Act 3 – The Twist

You find a survivor… but they attack you. Turns out they were trying to destroy the transmitter, not escape.

Final logs reveal: You were exposed to the signal before landing.

You were never sent for rescue — the signal lured you here to spread it.

🎯 Ending Choices (Multiple Endings):

Destroy the Signal (Sacrifice): You detonate the station, preventing the signal from spreading, dying a hero.

Escape: You flee with the transmitter, but the signal follows you. In post-credit: global outbreak.

Join It: You give in, open the sealed chamber — and the screen fades to static. Humanity’s end begins.

🧩 Cool Mechanics & Twists:

Signal Interference: Audio & visual distortions intensify the closer you get to the source.

AI Mimicry: Enemies mimic the voices of your team to lure you.

Weapon Jam / Light Flicker Events: Random chances where your gun or flashlight malfunctions.

Flashback Vision: Short memory glitches where you see the lab's past for 2-3 seconds at a time.

🛠️ Web Technologies:

Three.js / Babylon.js or Unity WebGL for FPS gameplay

Firebase / Supabase for saving progress or stats

Web Audio API for 3D sound and creepy effects

Post-processing shaders for hallucinations and signal interference



✅ Smart Add-Ons (That Don’t Overcomplicate)
1. 🧠 Mind Fracture Mechanic (Madness Meter)

A subtle “madness” meter affected by:

Staying near the signal too long

Being in darkness

Killing certain enemies

Effect:

Mild hallucinations → severe ones

Enemies appear where they aren’t

UI glitches, fake inventory items

Your own voice plays back reversed/distorted

Why? Makes players question what’s real. Adds replayability and psychological tension.

2. 🎧 Sound-Based Enemy AI

Enemies react to sound:

Gunshots

Running

Doors opening

You can sneak past or distract them using thrown objects (rocks, tools).

Why? Creates tension and encourages strategy.

3. 🎞️ Flashback Cutscenes (Found Memories)

Scattered items (e.g. a bloodied photo, broken headset) trigger short interactive flashbacks:

You're a scientist

You're the test subject

You're already infected

Why? Adds storytelling depth without long cutscenes.

4. 🔀 Randomized Layout / Encounters

Small procedural elements:

Enemy placement randomizes slightly

2–3 rooms change layout per playthrough

Random hallucination events

Why? Boosts replayability without extending length.

5. 🔒 Optional Secret Ending

If players find all hidden logs or resist the signal without firing a bullet, unlock a rare 4th ending:

You never existed. You were just another experiment. The station reboots.

Why? Mystery + reward for exploration or alternate playstyle (stealth, pacifist).
